This is the collaboration of @Anedot team members and friends.

Clone or copy userstyle.css into:
`~/Library/Application Support/Flowdock/`

Your Flowdock will look like our Flowdock. :+1:

## Simple Install or Update for Mac

If you don't want to hassle with moving files around, [download `AFDT Updater`](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ig88ajs4ahizzm1/AACmckmqnLdVybWMyxaQsxF9a?dl=1 "Download `AFDT Updater`") download `AFDT Updater` (Anedot Flowdock Theme Updater) and run the application on your computer. AFDT Updater will fetch the latest theme and install it for you.

*Inspired by Slack and @rnarius and Flowdock's reference to rnarius' custom style repo.*
